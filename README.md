# Hello-World
just another repository

Calvin Reed has arrived.
Hello there, I enjoy learning new concepts and ideas as well as refreshing on old ideas long forgotten.
I am excited to see what I can learn through github.
Currently, I am working on learning to use Tidyverse in R.
The package seems to be a good one for cleaning up data.
I have yet to come across any clean data in working with people data.
Hopefully, it will make life easier, faster, and more efficient.
